# LTI-ST
This code is mainly for understanding our TIP paper [Zero-Shot Learning to Index on Semantic Trees for Scalable Image Retrieval](https://github.com/kanshichao/LTI-ST). We will continue to maintain this project to further improve our work. Our results on the paper is implemented based on caffe framework, this project will based on the more widely used pytorch framework.
